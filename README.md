fooster-reveal-multiplex
========================

fooster-reveal-multiplex is a web application for generating token and id pairs for multiplex functionality of reveal.js. Much of the code is taken from the [multiplex plugin](https://github.com/reveal/multiplex) of reveal.js. It supports namespaced presentations in such a way that a single presentation can have a global controller and automatically connect with the global controller.
